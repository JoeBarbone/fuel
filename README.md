# Fuel
React/Firebase app to track fuel consumption

This webapp will be used to further my understanding of CRUD with React/Firebase.

# Setup
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap  
npm install react-router-dom  
add to index.js: import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
npm install firebase
npm install moment


# Database structure
This is a Firebase that is a new app added to the VeMa project. This was done because I am running out of Firebase projects and wanted to test adding an app to an existing project. Unfortunately, this means I will need to combine collections.

* id - auto created
* date - transaction date Need to use Moment for this
* station - gas station name
* gallons - number of gallons
* price - price per gallon
* vehicle - vehicle receiving fuel

# Hosting
Hosting will be provided by Google/Firebase
